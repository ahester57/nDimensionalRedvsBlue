The red marker starts at the lower-left corner ::= ```[0, ROWS-1, 0, ROWS-1, ...]```

The blue markers starts at the opposite corner ::= ```[ROWS-1, 0, ROWS-1, ...]```

The first to complete a random walk to the opponent's home tile wins.
If a marker lands on an occupied tile, they are sent back to their home
location.

For a school project in which we must examine an independent variable's effect
on a chosen dependent variable.

My independent variable: Number of dimensions, square grid locked at 4^(ndims)  
My dependent variable: Number of moves the winner must take to win. 

Each run simulates 10 games of each dimensions, 1-5

Or you can have a custom game:  
Enter a number of dimensions: 2-5  
Enter a number of rows: 2-8

See who wins.
