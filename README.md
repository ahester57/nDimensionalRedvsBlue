# n-Dimensional Red vs Blue Game

The red marker starts at the lower-left corner ::= [0, ROWS-1, 0, ROWS-1, ...] 

The blue markers starts at the opposite corner ::= [ROWS-1, 0, ROWS-1, ...]

The first to complete a random walk to the opponent's home tile wins.
If a marker lands on an occupied tile, they are sent back to their home
location.

For a school project in which we must examine an independent variable's effect
on a chosen dependent variable.

My independent variable: Number of dimensions, square grid locked at 4^(ndims)

My dependent variable: Number of moves the winner must take to win. 

Enter a number of dimensions: 2-5

Enter a number of rows: 2-8

See who wins.
